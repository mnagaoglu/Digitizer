# Digitizer
![icon.png](icon.png)

A MATLAB app to extract data from images of data plots.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/mnagaoglu/Digitizer/wiki) for instructions on how to use it. 

I was heavily inspired by [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/), which has been very helpful for me over the years. Digitizer is no way near that in terms of functionality, however, it's a start. 

NOTE: Digitizer is under heavy development. Significant changes to workflow might happen.
